    "The refresh rate of HAT compatable waveshare displays is relatively slow (5-20 seconds) and does not support partial refreshes. This results in the display pulsing between an all-white and all-black state several times during each refresh. \n",

    "## Software Quick Install\n",
    "If you have a working EPD installed, the following instructions will get you up and runing quickly. If you do not yet have a working screen installed, check the Hardware Setup instructions below.\n",
    "1. Download the installable package from [git hub](https://github.com/txoof/slimpi_epd/raw/master/slimpi_latest.tgz)\n",
    "2. Decompress the tarball: `tar xvzf slimpi_latest.tgz`\n",
    "3. Run the installer: \n",
    "   * `install.sh` for a daemon that starts automatically at boot, or see below for running in user space\n",
    "   * `user_install.sh` to setup the user space configuration files\n",
    "4. Edit the appropriate configuation file: `/etc/slimpi.cfg` for daemon or `~/.config/com.txoof.slimpi/slimpi.cfg` for user space\n",
    "    * **Required** settings that must be set:\n",
    "        - `display = waveShareEPDType`\n",
    "        - example: `display = epd5in83`\n",
    "            * The display type should match the model number of your HAT compatable e-Paper display\n",
    "        - `player_name = \"Name Of LMS Player on Local Network\"` \n",
    "        - example: `player_name = slimpi`\n",

    "    * The HiFiBerry DAC+ PRO and similar boards add high-quality audio output to the Pi so it can act as a display and also work as a LMS client player using squeezelite\n",
    "    * GPIO 2x20 headers **must be added** to the board to support WaveShare HAT\n",
    "    * HiFiBerry's [DAC+ Bundle](https://www.hifiberry.com/shop/bundles/hifiberry-dac-bundle-4/) with the following configuraiton is a good choice:\n",
