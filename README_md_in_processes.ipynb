    "SlimPi provides a *now playing* display for a selected Logitech Media Player. When the player is paused, an alternative screen is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default configuration shows the following information:\n",
    "<img width=\"300\" src=\"./docs/SlimPi_playing.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track Title\n",
    "* Artist Name\n",

    "The refresh rate of HAT compatable waveshare displays is relatively slow (5-20 seconds) and does not support partial refreshes. This results in the display pulsing between an all-white and all-black state several times during each refresh. \n",
