    "1. `./slimpi/slimpi.cfg` Basic default configuration file; this should not be edited\n",
    "2. `/etc/slimpi.cfg` System-wide configuration file; this can be used to set any system-wide default settings\n",
    "3. `~/.config/com.txoof.slimpi/slimpi.cfg` User level configuration file; this will be ignored when running as a daemon \n",
